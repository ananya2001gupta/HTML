HTML Project for Website - HTML 

I started by exploring HTML Development using some of the most commonly used tags and attributes. I learnt the composition of an HTML file, and some of the
essential components. I worked with HTML Spacing, Text Formatting, Lists, Images, Embedding Videos, Link Creation, Tables, and Forms. I also included a
hands-on project, that helps solidify the concepts.
