HTML Project for Website - HTML 

I started by exploring HTML Development using some of the most commonly used tags and attributes. I learnt the composition of an HTML file, and some of the
essential components. I worked with HTML Spacing, Text Formatting, Lists, Images, Embedding Videos, Link Creation, Tables, and Forms. I also included a
hands-on project, that helps solidify the concepts.

topics are- 
doc.html - basic structure of html.
document.html - basic structure of html with heading.
head section.html - webpage heading and decription or introduction and title.
my first webpage.html - basic webpage.
first doc.html - use of <p> ... </p> uses for paragraph spacing.
linebreak.html - use of <br> in between the sentence to break the line.
nonbreakingspaces - use of &nbsp; for single space.
headertag.html - use of header and header h1 is largest size and header h6 is smallest size.
textformatinganddecoration.html - <strong>..</strong> for bold text
